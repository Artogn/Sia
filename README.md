What Is Sia?
============

Sia is a new cryptocurrency that uses proof-of-storage instead of proof-of-work. This creates a blockchain that is protected by an expensive resource that is also useful for storing files over a distributed network.

The proof-of-storage algorithm uses a blocktree instead of a blockchain. This means that each participant in the network only sees the transactions that are relevant to them, instead of seeing every transaction that occurs over the network. This is done in a secure and trust-free way.

Because of the consensus-algorithm based structure of the blocktree, there can be no double spends! Additonally, the amount of time needed to confirm a transaction is expected to be under 1 minute. Under certain circumstances, transactions can be confirmed in under 10 seconds.

Finally, Sia introduces the concept of script-based wallets as opposed to public key based wallets. This adds an enormous amount of power to wallets by allowing them to have arbitrary volumes of public keys and arbitrary rules for committing transactions.

The network is named Sia or Sianet, and the currency is called siacoin, which is shortened to scn.
